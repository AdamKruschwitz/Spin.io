# Spin.io
A .io type game where many players congregate on a server and fight each other using swords that constantly spin around their character.

## Technology Used
The game is coded in JS using the Phaser 3 framework. This allows us to run the game in browser and host it wherever we please. For playing over the internet, I believe we will be using the Socket.io framework, but as we haven't gotten to this part in development that is subject to change.
